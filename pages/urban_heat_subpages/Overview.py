st.write("Urban heat islands are areas, such as cities, that experience significantly higher temperatures than their surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon occurs due to several factors:Surface Absorption: Dark surfaces like asphalt and concrete absorb more sunlight and heat, leading to warmer temperatures. Reduced Ventilation: Tall buildings and narrow streets can block wind flow, preventing natural cooling. Human Activities: Energy consumption and industrial processes contribute to heat emissions, further increasing temperatures. Urban Geometry: The layout of cities can create urban canyons that trap heat. Overall, urban heat islands pose significant challenges to urban environments, affecting air quality and human health.")
